# Anti-Patterns to Avoid

## In Analysis

- Cherry-picking dramatic reviews over representative ones
- Conflating iOS and Android (analyze separately)
- Ignoring price context ($2/mo "expensive" ≠ $50/mo "expensive")
- Calling hypotheses "root causes" — reviews show patterns, not confirmed causation

## In Recommendations

- **Price-cutting reflex** — "too expensive" usually means "not enough value"
- **Trying to fix all 8 categories** — top 3 only
- **Ignoring silent churn** — supplement with in-app surveys
- **PM-only action items** — always include marketer-actionable steps (creative, messaging, targeting)
- **Patronizing CTA copy** — no "If you're being honest" or "gut feeling" language
- **Positioning complementary tools as competitors** — RevenueCat is a complement, not a rival
